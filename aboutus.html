<h2>The Product</h6>
<p>Unconfined's primary aim is to create a payment processor compatible with many currencies, and easy to use for businesses. We'd like users to be able to pay in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, etc, with a consistent user
experience for each one. We've embarked on this project because we thought many mainstream payment processors were either too cluttered - they were overly complicated for 
both the merchant and the customer to work with, or simply not powerful enough - they only accepted one currency, no easy payment method, etc.
<br><br>
Our secondary aim is to integrate our own paypal-esque one click payment service that makes it easy for customers to pay on any website that uses Unconfined. The principles of 
this are simple: A user can make an account with Unconfined, and deposit cryptocurrency into it. Then, when purchasing an item from a website that uses Unconfined, the 
user will have a "one-click pay" option, which draws funds from their account and uses them to pay the merchant, free of any hastle of creating a transaction from the user's 
private wallet.
<br><br>
The service is free during early development - when an early version of the final product is complete, a subscription one a per-month basis will be required to continue using Unconfined. We'll make sure it's 
an economical price - we want your business just as much as you want ours. We'll take no percentages of the transactions you handle either - any money earned will go directly to your wallet.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Team and Roadmap</h6>
<p>
Our team members, who prefer to remain unnamed at the moment for personal reasons, consist of a variety of unique talents. Our strong suits come in backend framework and networking. Several developers 
have experience with: game design, cryptocurrency applications (dApps and external chain manipulation), social media website framework, and networking. Please excuse the UI quirks and inconsistency of 
the site; none of us are great at UI design, and we're working on finding someone to join the team who can give us a fresher look.
<br><br>
As for the Roadmap, at the time of writing (August 2018) the basic processor (without the 1 click pay features) works as intended, currently supporting only Ethereum. Next our our list is accounts and one click payment for Ethereum.
After that, we'll expand the basic processor structure to work with a variety of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash are first in line). After that, we'll work on refining our current systems and adding one click 
payment support for more currencies.
